**Climate Data Exploration Project**

This project aims to explore and analyze climate data, focusing on global temperature change and CO2 emissions evolution of all countries from 1990 to 2018. Additionally, we have compared the data for France, Germany, and China with the global average to gain insights into their contributions to climate change.

Climate change is one of the most pressing global issues of our time. To better understand its dynamics, this project delves into two key aspects: global temperature change and CO2 emissions evolution. We have used data from the Climate Watch Data Portal to analyze how the emissions of all countries have evolved over nearly three decades.

Data Sources
Global Temperature Data: We obtained global temperature data from [source name/link].
CO2 Emissions Data: CO2 emissions data for all countries were sourced from the Climate Watch Data Portal [link to data portal].
Analysis
1. Global Temperature Change
We began by analyzing the global temperature change from 1990 to 2018. The data was processed and visualized to identify trends, anomalies, and potential correlations with other factors such as CO2 emissions.

2. CO2 Emissions Evolution
The second phase of our analysis focused on the evolution of CO2 emissions for all countries during the same period. We visualized the data to identify countries with significant emissions growth or reduction and looked for regional patterns.
